# Troubleshooting

## Styles are appearing as expected

This can happen when multiple instances of Emotion or MDX are installed in a project, use `npm ls` to see which dependencies are installed in a given project and make sure there is only one version listed for each library's packages.

## MDX Issues

This library is *only* compatible with MDX v1, which is currently in alpha.

## Images aren't appearing where expected

Due to how MDX Blocks parses child elements, the [remark-unwrap-images][] plugin is required.
Be sure this plugin is provided as an option in your MDX configuration.
