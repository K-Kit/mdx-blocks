# Themes

Themes in MDX Blocks consist of two parts:

- `theme` (object) a [Styled System theme][theme specification] object
- `components` (object) an object of MDX components or component styles, with support for [Styled System][] props

MDX Blocks includes a base theme by default that has minimal styling and is intended to make customization easier.

## Built-in Themes

MDX Blocks includes several built-in themes that can be used out-of-the-box or serve as a basis for custom themes.
To use a built-in theme, import it and pass it to the `BlocksProvider` component at the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BlocksProvider } from 'mdx-blocks'
import { future } from 'mdx-blocks/themes'

export default props =>
  <BlocksProvider {...future}>
    {props.children}
  </BlocksProvider>
```

Currently the following themes are available:

- `funk`
- `future`
- `roboto`
