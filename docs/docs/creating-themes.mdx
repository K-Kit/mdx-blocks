# Creating Themes

To completely customize the look and feel of MDX Blocks, you can create custom themes that define colors, typographic styles, base components, and more.
See the [themes module][] for examples to get started.

## Theme Object

The `theme` object follows Styled System's [Theme Specification][].
All scale objects within the theme can be extended to include additional values.

```js
// theme shape
theme: {
  colors: {
    text,
    background,
    primary,
    secondary,
    highlight,
    muted,
  },
  space: [],
  fonts: {
    body,
    heading,
    monospace,
  },
  fontSizes: [],
  fontWeights: {
    body,
    bold,
    heading,
  },
  lineHeights: {
    body,
    heading,
  },
  maxWidths: {
    container,
  }
}
```

## Components Object

The `components` object corresponds to MDX components and can include either React components or CSS style objects with Styled System props.
See the [themes docs](/docs/themes) for more info.
