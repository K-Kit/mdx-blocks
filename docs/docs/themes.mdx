# Themes

Themes in MDX Blocks consist of two parts:

- `theme` (object) a [Styled System theme][theme specification] object
- `components` (object) an object of MDX components or component styles, with support for [Styled System][] props

MDX Blocks includes a base theme by default that has minimal styling and is intended to make customization easier.

## Built-in Themes

MDX Blocks includes several built-in themes that can be used out-of-the-box or serve as a basis for custom themes.
To use a built-in theme, import it and pass it to the `BlocksProvider` component at the root of your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BlocksProvider } from 'mdx-blocks'
import { future } from 'mdx-blocks/themes'

export default props =>
  <BlocksProvider {...future}>
    {props.children}
  </BlocksProvider>
```

Currently the following themes are available:

- `funk`
- `future`
- `roboto`

## Components Object

The `components` object in MDX Blocks maps to MDX components and can be comprised of either actual React components or CSS style objects.

```jsx
components: {
  // example with React component
  h1: props => <h1 {...props} />,
  // example with CSS style object
  h2: {
    color: 'tomato',
  }
}
```

When using style objects for components, [Styled System][] props can be used for color, spacing, and typography, allowing you to use values from the `theme` object.
For example, the following picks up font size and colors from the theme:

```js
components: {
  h1: {
    fontSize: 6,
    color: 'primary',
  },
}
```

The Styled System props can also accept arrays for mobile-first responsive styles.

```js
components: {
  h1: {
    // responsive font size
    fontSize: [4, 5, 6],
  },
}
```

## Layout Blocks

Each layout component can accept the same `components` object type to create contextual style changes on a per-block basis.
These nested blocks will inherit components from the parent `BlocksProvider` component.
