# BlocksProvider

The `BlocksProvider` component provides the base context for theming and MDX components.
All MDX Blocks should be nested within the `BlocksProvider`, and it can live at the root level of a page or an entire application.
Internally, it uses MDX's `MDXProvider` and Emotion's `ThemeProvider`.

## Props

- `theme` (object) Emotion theme object that conforms to Styled System's [Theme Specification]
- `styles` (object) Object of styles for components
- `components` (object) MDX components

See the [Themes docs](/docs/themes) for more information.
